This Jorge Nicolau's Personal Page build upon the template Strata by [@ajlkn](https://aj.lkn.io/) from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

This template is free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (https://html5up.net/license)

A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of my personal site. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.

Demo images (not included) courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images you can use for pretty much whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :) contact the template's author:

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
